    "On each iteration of the loop, the i-th column and row are configured to have a weight of 1. This ensures that each row and column expands at the same rate whenever the window is resized. The minsize argument is set to 75 for each column and 50 for each row. This makes sure the Label widget always displays its text without chopping off any characters, even if the window size is extremely small.\n"
